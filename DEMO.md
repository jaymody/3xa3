- demonstrate testing framework
- show how snippets are sourced and added
- show which parts of the code we changed
    - we kept structure of main/commandline
    - we kept the overall architecture of screen and game
    - we had to heavily modify the state machine for game since accounting for "enter" and blank lines is more complicated than one long string
    - we were able to copy over a good amount of screen.py
    - we refactored/moved around a lot of stuff to have a much better seperation of concerns and stronger OOP principles
